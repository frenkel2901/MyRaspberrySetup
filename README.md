„ÄêHow to use with Raspbian/Ubuntu Mate/Win10 IoT Core System

- Step 1, Install Raspbian official image (–ò–ª–∏ –ª—é–±–æ–π –¥—Ä—É–≥–æ–π –æ–±—Ä–∞–∑, –Ω–∞–ø—Ä–∏–º–µ—Ä Kali)

1) Download the latest image from the official download.
2) Install the system according to the official tutorial steps.

- Step 2, modify the ‚Äúconfig.txt‚Äù

After the programming of Step1 is completed, open the config.txt file of TF card root directory and add the following code at the end of the file, save and eject Micro SD Card safely:

```
~~max_usb_current=1~~ –≠—Ç—É —Å—Ç—Ä–æ–∫—É —è –Ω–µ –∏—Å–ø–æ–ª—å–∑—É—é

hdmi_force_hotplug=1
config_hdmi_boost=7
hdmi_group=2
hdmi_mode=87
hdmi_drive=1
display_rotate=0
hdmi_cvt 1024 600 60 6 0 0 0
```

- Step 3, Drive the 7inch HDMI JRP7007 with the Raspberry Pi

Insert the TF Card to Raspberry Pi, connect the Raspberry Pi and LCD by HDMI cable;
connect USB cable to one of the four USB ports of Raspberry Pi,and connect the other end of the USB cable to the USB port of the LCD;
then supply power to Raspberry Pi; after that if the display and touch both are OK,it means drive successfully (please use the full 3A for power supply).
